# What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to get the best possible outputs from AI language models. Think of it as learning to communicate effectively with a highly capable but literal assistant.

## Why It Matters

- **Better Results**: Well-crafted prompts produce more accurate, relevant, and useful responses
- **Efficiency**: Good prompts save time by reducing back-and-forth iterations
- **Consistency**: Structured prompts help achieve reliable outputs across similar tasks
- **Cost Savings**: Fewer tokens used means lower API costs for those using paid services

The 5-Part Prompt Template
1. ROLE: Who is the AI acting as?
2. CONTEXT: What's the situation/background?
3. TASK: What specific action do you need?
4. FORMAT: How should it be structured?
5. CONSTRAINTS: Length, tone, what to include/avoid

Example: Fujifilm Apeos C325 Printer Setup Guide

[ROLE]: You are a technical writer for office equipment

[CONTEXT]: New office manager needs to set up the Apeos C325 
multifunction printer for a 15-person team. Common issue: 
connecting to network and enabling scan-to-email.

[TASK]: Create a quick setup checklist

[FORMAT]: 8 numbered steps, with one troubleshooting tip

[CONSTRAINTS]: Under 200 words, non-technical language, 
mention wireless and mobile printing capabilities


Speaker notes"
Say: "Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're covering prompt engineering - essentially, how to talk to AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to get exactly what you need. I'm using our Fujifilm printer products as examples since we all know them well."

ROLE - "Who is the AI pretending to be? A technical writer? Marketing person? Customer service rep?"
CONTEXT - "What's the situation? What problem are you solving?"
TASK - "The specific action you need done"
FORMAT - "How should it look? Bullets? Paragraphs? Table?"
CONSTRAINTS - "Length limits, tone, what to include or avoid"

Say: "Not every prompt needs all five parts, but the more complex your need, the more helpful this structure becomes."

"Let's see this in action with our Apeos C325 office printer."
