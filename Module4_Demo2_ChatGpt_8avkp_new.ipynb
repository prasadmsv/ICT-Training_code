      "📝 Generated Response:\n",
      "Sure! Here’s a breakdown of those fundamental programming concepts:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Variables\n",
      "**Definition:** Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. Think of them as containers for holding values.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:** \n",
      "In Python:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "age = 25\n",
      "name = \"Alice\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "Here, `age` is a variable that holds the integer value `25`, and `name` is a variable that holds the string `\"Alice\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Functions\n",
      "**Definition:** Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs (return values).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "In Python:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "message = greet(\"Alice\")\n",
      "print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, `greet` is a function that takes a `name` as an argument and returns a greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Loops\n",
      "**Definition:** Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They are useful for iterating over data structures or performing repetitive tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types:**\n",
      "- **For Loop:** Iterates over a sequence (like a list or range).\n",
      "- **While Loop:** Continues to execute as long as a condition is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:** \n",
      "In Python:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",
      "    print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
      "\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Classes\n",
